SYNOPSIS
       xcrysden [special-options]
       xcrysden [special-options] format-options file|directory


DESCRIPTION
       XCrySDen  is  a  crystalline and molecular structure visualisation program, which aims at display of isosurfaces and contours, which can be superimposed on
       crystalline structures and interactively rotated and manipulated.


SPECIAL OPTIONS
       -h
       --help
           Display help message.


       -v
       --version
           Display program version information.

       -u id
       --use id
           Load XCrySDen embedded into container window with window-ID=id.

       -r dim
       --reducedim dim
           Reduce periodic dimension of XSF file to dim. Must be specified before --xsf option, e.g., xcrysden -r 2 --xsf file.


       -c file
       --custom file
           Load custom-definitions from a specified file (the syntax is that of ~/.xcrysden/custom-definitions).

       -a file
       --attributes file
           Load attributes from file. The format of the attributes file is the following:

                   ELEMENTCOLOR
                   atomic-number1   red1 blue1 green1
                   atomic-number2   red2 blue2 green2
                   ...
                   ELEMENTRADIUS
                   atomic-number1   radius1
                   atomic-number2   radius2
                   ...


       -l file
       --lights file
           Load lights parameters from XCrySDen's lights formatted file.


FORMAT OPTIONS
       --xsf file
           Load structure from XCrySDen's-Structure-File (XSF) formatted file.

       --animxsf file
       --axsf file
           Load structres from Animated-XCrySDen's-Structure-File (AXSF) formatted file.

       --bxsf file
           Load bands from BXSF (Band-XSF) file and visualize Fermi Surface.

       --xmol file
       --xyz file
           Load structure from XYZ formatted file.

       --pdb file
           Load structure from PDB formatted file.

       --gzmat file
           Load structure from Gaussian Z-matrix (requires Open-Babel program).

       --gaussian_out file
       --gxx_out file
       --g98_out file
           Load structure from Gaussian output file. Only single point calculation and optimization run is supported so far. For the optimization run it is possi‚Äê
           ble to render all the structures that were produced during the run.

       --cube file
       --gXX_cube file
       --g98_cube file
           Load  structure  from  Gaussian  cube file. The cube file should be produced with the Cube=Cards option. Only scalar cube files are supported, that is,
           Cube=(Cards,Density) or Cube=(Cards,Orbitals) or Cube=(Cards,Potential). Refer to GAUSSIAN manual for the meaning of this keywords.


       --crystal_inp file
           Load structure from CRYSTAL (http://http://www.crystal.unito.it/) input file.


       --crystal_f9 file
           Load structure from CRYSTAL (http://http://www.crystal.unito.it/) fortran unit 9.


       --wien_struct filehead|file|directory
           Load structure from WIEN2k (http://www.wien2k.at/) struct-file, where:

               filehead = name of struct file without .struct extension,
               file = filename,
               directory = name of case directory.


       --wien_kpath directory|struct-file
           Read struct file and render first Brillouin zone with special k-points. K-path can be selected interactively by mouse-clicking  the  special  k-points.
           User  must specify EMIN and EMAX energies and total number of k-points along the path. This number is merely an estimation of total number of k-points,
           since XCrySDen tries to get very uniform sampling of k-points along the path (don't specify WIEN2k maximum allowed number of k-points,  since  XCrySDen
           maight generate few points more).


       --wien_renderdensity directory
           Read struct, output, and rho files and renders crystalline structure and precomputed charge density.


       --wien_density direcory
           Either 2D or 3D region for charge density calculation is interactively chosen by mouse-clicking. XCrySDen generates in5 file(s), calculates and renders
           charge density either as isolines/colorplanes (2D) or isosurfaces (3D).


       --wien_fermisurface directory
           Pop-up a task window for Fermi surface creation.  After several steps the Fermi surface is (hopefully) drawn as 3D isosurface.


       --fhi_inpini file
           Load structure from FHI98MD inp.ini formated file.


       --fhi_coord file
           Load structure from FHI98MD coord.out formated file.


       --pwi
       --pw_inp file
           Load structure from pw.x  input  file.  pw.x  is  a  pseudopotential  planewave  program  of  the  Quantum-ESPRESSO  distribution  (http://www.quantum-
           espresso.org/).

       --pwo
       --pw_out file
           Load  structure  from  pw.x  output  file.  pw.x  is  a  pseudopotential  planewave  program  of the Quantum-ESPRESSO distribution (http://www.quantum-
           espresso.org/).


       -s script
       --script script
           Load script from file containing Tcl script.
